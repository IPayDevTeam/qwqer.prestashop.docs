# Module features

The module provide functionality to place **QWQER** delivery orders directly inside you PrestaShop store.
<br />
There are main three things to interact with the module.


## Warehouse

Warehouse entities may be positioned as pickup points from where **QWQER** couriers will receive shipments.
<br />
*You can manage as many warehouses as you want.*


## Order placement

To begin shipping by **QWQER** you must open a special modal window, choose your predefined warehouse, and validate the destination address.

Automatically will be calculated estimated price of the shipment, but keep in mind that after each change in a modal window you must recalculate the price.

Afterward, you are able to process the order placement and payment.


## Shipment orders

Placed **QWQER** orders may be managed by you inside your PrestaShop store. That is you can view all of them, fetch and update statuses.
<br />
This is a need to manage your PrestaShop orders and keep informed about the shipment progress.
